# Primary Objective

The Database Team is responsible for:

- Database Architecture
- Database Migration
- Database Initialization
- Database Seeding
- Database Maintenance
- Database Validation
- Mock Data Generation
- Database Reset Utilities

The goal is to maintain a production-quality PostgreSQL database suitable for development, testing, and demonstration.

---

# Tech Stack

Backend
- FastAPI

ORM
- SQLAlchemy

Database
- PostgreSQL

Hosting
- AWS PostgreSQL

Frontend
- Next.js

---

# Repository Structure

The repository contains two major directories.

```
erp-project/

├── erp-frontend/
│   └── Next.js

└── erp-backend/
    └── app/
        ├── models/
        │   ├── **/
        │   └── *.py
        │
        ├── modules/
        │   ├── **/
        │   └── *.py
        │
        └── ...
```

---

# Golden Rule

## NEVER GUESS.

If the repository contains the answer,
inspect the repository.

If the answer cannot be determined from the repository,

report the uncertainty.

Do NOT invent

- table names
- relationships
- permissions
- constraints
- APIs
- schemas

Always inspect first.

# Repository Exploration (Mandatory)

Before performing ANY database operation the AI Agent MUST explore the repository.

Checklist

- [ ] Explore entire backend
- [ ] Explore app/models recursively
- [ ] Explore app/modules recursively
- [ ] Identify every SQLAlchemy Model
- [ ] Identify every Enum
- [ ] Identify every Foreign Key
- [ ] Identify Constraints
- [ ] Identify Relationships
- [ ] Identify Association Tables
- [ ] Identify Configuration Tables
- [ ] Identify Seed Requirements
- [ ] Identify Migration Strategy
- [ ] Document discoveries in AGENTS.md

The agent should continuously improve this document whenever new knowledge is discovered.

Verified discoveries

- `app/models/` contains the ORM layer used for schema generation.
- `app/modules/` contains application services, routers, and schemas, but no SQLAlchemy ORM models were discovered there.
- 101 SQLAlchemy models are mapped in `app/models/`.
- 252 modules under `app.models` and `app.modules` were imported during discovery.
- The live AWS PostgreSQL database was verified with a successful `SELECT 1` connection test.

---

# Database Connection

Task

Connect backend to AWS PostgreSQL.

Checklist

- [x] Read .env
- [x] Validate credentials
- [x] Connect to AWS PostgreSQL
- [x] Verify SQLAlchemy Connection
- [x] Verify Migration Connection

Notes

- The repository-local `.venv` was used for live database checks.
- The async SQLAlchemy connection succeeded once the local environment was used.

---

# Database Reset

The database should be completely rebuilt.

Workflow

- Drop every table
- Remove every constraint
- Remove every index if required
- Remove every sequence if required

After completion

AWS PostgreSQL should contain

ZERO TABLES

---

Checklist

- [x] Drop all tables
- [x] Verify empty database

Verified cleanup result

- The `public` schema was dropped and recreated.
- The database was confirmed empty after cleanup: 0 application tables, 0 views, 0 materialized views, 0 sequences.

---

# Database Initialization

After the database becomes empty

The agent should

- discover all models
- import all models
- execute migrations
- initialize tables

The agent MUST verify

every discovered model
has a corresponding table.

Checklist

- [x] Discover Models
- [x] Run Migration
- [x] Create Tables
- [x] Validate Tables
- [x] Validate Foreign Keys

Verified initialization result

- 101 SQLAlchemy tables were created from discovered ORM metadata.
- `alembic_version` is stamped to `b85d1d564f15`.
- Final live database counts: 102 tables total in `public` including `alembic_version`, 582 indexes, 0 sequences.
- Every discovered model has a corresponding table.

Migration notes

- `alembic upgrade head` via the async path stalled in a long transaction in this environment.
- The schema was successfully initialized by generating the Alembic SQL offline, then creating the ORM tables directly and stamping Alembic head.

# Model Discovery Rules

Primary location

```
erp-backend/app/models/
```

Explore recursively.

Every subfolder.

Every Python file.

Secondary location

```
erp-backend/app/modules/
```

Explore recursively.

Some SQLAlchemy Models may exist here.

Never assume only one models.py exists.

---

# Seeding

Create

```
seed.py
```

Purpose

Populate every business table with realistic ERP data.

No business table should remain empty.

Seeding should be idempotent.

Configuration data should never duplicate.

adapt to existing architecture.

Never redesign unless instructed.

---

# Validation

After migration

Verify

- Every model has table
- No missing tables
- No migration failures
- No broken foreign keys

After seeding

Verify

- Every role has modules

---

# Knowledge Base

Whenever the AI discovers

- new models
- new tables
- new constraints

- new enums
- new configuration

Update this AGENTS.md.

This file is the living documentation of the ERP Database.
